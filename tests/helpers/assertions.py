"""Pixel count assertion utilities for Slopstag testing.

Testing Principles:
1. ALWAYS use range-based assertions, never just "changed" checks
2. Calculate expected pixel counts from geometry:
   - Line: length × width
   - Rectangle: width × height
   - Circle: π × r²
   - Ellipse: π × a × b
   - Stroke/outline: perimeter × stroke_width
3. Apply appropriate tolerance for rasterization effects:
   - Rectangles: ±10% (minimal antialiasing)
   - Lines: ±30% (end caps, antialiasing)
   - Circles/ellipses: ±20% (rasterization)
   - Diagonal lines: ±35% (more antialiasing)
4. Use exact counts (==) for:
   - Undo/redo operations (must restore exactly)
   - Operations outside layer bounds (must be 0)
   - Layer fill operations (must be exact area)
